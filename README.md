# US-Census-Regions
Data from US Census Bureau on State and Regions

United States Census Bureau. “Census Regions and Divisions of the United States.”  https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf.

Halpert, Chris. “census regions/us census bureau region and divisions.csv.” https://github.com/cphalpert/census-regions/blob/master/us%20census%20bureau%20regions%20and%20divisions.csv

The US Census Bureau does not assign regions to Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. I enhanced the dataset from the US Census Bureau and Chris Halpert to include rows for these US territories.
